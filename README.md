## Download and Install Coursera-dl

This article is just a memo for me that remind me of how to download Coursera contents, such as videos and scripts, to my own computer using coursera-dl.
Setup coursera-dl.

Recommended installation method for all Operating Systems

cousera-dl is a python tool. (https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl)

Python environment is required, but even windows is OK for using this tool.

From a command line (preferably, from a virtual environment), simply issue the command:

    pip install coursera-dl
## cant access coursera ?

##  Coursera-dl bug 
### HTTPError: 400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://api.coursera.org/api/login/v3
#### first way
For anyone looking for help I want to point out that after logging in with (https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us), you must wait for a few minute than just keep trying. By keep trying I mean spamming your command over and over again and it will somehow work (at least it works for me, I need to retry the command about 10 times before it will work).

Login to Coursera once through the browser.   https://www.coursera.org/?authMode=login

Create coursera-dl.conf file.

Place the file namely ‘coursera-dl.conf’ in the directory where to use coursera-dl command.

The example of the format is below.

	-- username "your email"
	
	-- password "your pass"
	
	-- subtitle-language en

	--cauth "your cauth using below plugins"

Execute a command and trouble shooting.

Now, you can use coursera-dl.

coursera-dl <course name>

You can get the course name in the url of the course you would like to get contents.

For example, if you would like to get the contents in a course below,

https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-in-computer-vision

you should type the command below.

coursera-dl deep-learning-in-computer-vision

And Importantly, please note that when you use coursera-dl command, coursera-dl might get error with “400 Bad request” at the coursera authentication process.

To get avoid this, We need a pache mentioned in this comment and need a cookies.txt of coursera.

The cookies can be downloaded using chrome extension
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt/bgaddhkoddajcdgocldbbfleckgcbcid?hl=en
or this firefox extension:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/

That’s it. Thanks!


## Running the script

Refer to coursera-dl --help for a complete, up-to-date reference on the runtime options supported by this utility.

    General:                     coursera-dl -u <user> -p <pass> modelthinking-004

    With CAUTH parameter:	 coursera-dl -ca 'some-ca-value-from-browser' modelthinking-00
Here are some examples of how to invoke coursera-dl from the command line:

    Without -p field:            coursera-dl -u <user> modelthinking-004
    Multiple classes:            coursera-dl -u <user> -p <pass> saas historyofrock1-001 algo-2012-002
    Filter by section name:      coursera-dl -u <user> -p <pass> -sf "Chapter_Four" crypto-004
    Filter by lecture name:      coursera-dl -u <user> -p <pass> -lf "3.1_" ml-2012-002
    Download only ppt files:     coursera-dl -u <user> -p <pass> -f "ppt" qcomp-2012-001
    Use a ~/.netrc file:         coursera-dl -n -- matrix-001
    Get the preview classes:     coursera-dl -n -b ni-001
	Download videos at 720p:     coursera-dl -n --video-resolution 720p ni-001
    Specify download path:       coursera-dl -n --path=C:\Coursera\Classes\ comnetworks-002
    Display help:                coursera-dl --help

    Maintain a list of classes in a dir:
      Initialize:              mkdir -p CURRENT/{class1,class2,..classN}
      Update:                  coursera-dl -n --path CURRENT `\ls CURRENT`

Note: If your ls command is aliased to display a colorized output, you may experience problems. Be sure to escape the ls command (use \ls) to assure that no special characters get sent to the script.

Note that we do support the New Platform ("on-demand") courses.

By default, videos are downloaded at 540p resolution. For on-demand courses, the --video-resolution flag accepts 360p, 540p, and 720p values.

To download just the .txt and/or .srt subtitle files instead of the videos, use -ignore-formats mp4 --subtitle-language en or whatever format the videos are encoded in and desired languages for subtitles.

On *nix platforms, the use of a ~/.netrc file is a good alternative to specifying both your username (i.e., your email address) and password every time on the command line. To use it, simply add a line like the one below to a file named .netrc in your home directory (or the equivalent, if you are using Windows) with contents like:

    machine coursera-dl login <user> password <pass>

Create the file if it doesn't exist yet. From then on, you can switch from using -u and -p to simply call coursera-dl with the option -n instead. This is especially convenient, as typing usernames (email addresses) and passwords directly on the command line can get tiresome (even more if you happened to choose a "strong" password).

Alternatively, if you want to store your preferred parameters (which might also include your username and password), create a file named coursera-dl.conf where the script is supposed to be executed, with the following format:

    --username <user>
    --password <pass>
    --subtitle-language en,zh-CN|zh-TW
    --download-quizzes
    #--mathjax-cdn https://cdn.bootcss.com/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js
    # more other parameters

Parameters which are specified in the file will be overriden if they are provided again on the commandline.

Note: In coursera-dl.conf, all the parameters should not be wrapped with quotes.
